            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="question">Tell Me About Yourself ? </div>
                <div class="answer">You can start by sharing some of your personal interests and experiences that don't relate directly to work, such as a favorite hobby or a brief account of where you grew up, your education, and what motivates you.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="question">Why Are You the Best Person for the Job? </div>
                <div class="answer">Make your response a confident, concise, focused sales pitch that explains what you have to offer and why you should get the job. This is a good time to review the qualifications and the requirements in the job listing, so you can craft a response that aligns with what the interviewer is looking for. </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="question">Why Do You Want This Job? </div>
                <div class="answer">This interview question gives you an opportunity to show the interviewer what you know about the job and the company, so take time beforehand to thoroughly research the company, its products, services, culture, and mission.

                    Be specific about what makes you a good fit for this role, and mention aspects of the company and position that appeal to you most.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="question">What Is Your Greatest Strength?</div>
                <div class="answer">When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that qualify you for that specific job, and that will set you apart from other candidates.

                    When you're answering this question, remember to “show” rather than “tell.” For example, rather than stating that you are an excellent problem solver, instead tell a story that demonstrates this, ideally drawing on an anecdote from your professional experience.</div>
